Start:
  1. Avernus Premise
    - "Takes you from the city, to the nine hells, with devils and Mad Max like car battles along the way"
  2. Create Characters
    - "Create a persona built to slay hell itself, but perhaps because they there's a little bit of hell already inside them."
    - "Came to Baldur's Gate, for <dark secret> but the fall of Elturel and Baldur Gate's grand duke, spelled chaos for the city. You were forced to hold out in a ramshackle shelter, trying to avoid trouble from the gangs that rule the day, and the host of murderers who rule the night."
    - "The action starts in the middle of a wet market, which you came by in order to stock up your flophouse. It is musty with the smell of exotic spices and fineries. Little does anyone know that the tensions of a refugee nation are about to reach the boiling point."
    - Use a blank sheet or D&D beyond
    - https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters

    - Pick a class (suggest at least one player as Cleric or Paladin)
    - Pick a background
    - Put up a stat block
      - Use the preset numbers
      - Or roll 4d6 keep 3 x6
    - Explain proficiency, saves, attacks, skills
  3. Pick Dark Secret together (pg 208) 
  4. Designate a hideout
    - Where? Use the map of Lower City (avernus184)
    - What did it used to be?
    - 2 strengths:
        - Hidden (easy to avoid trouble)
        - Fortified (easy to defend)
        - Storefront (Use DMG to roll profit weekly)
        - Community Hub (easy to get gossip)
        - Homely (well stocked with mundane supplies, food, etc)
        - Cool (impresses people that you stay there)
    - 1 weakness:
        - Taken (got to fight or pay to keep the place)
        - Ugly (not impressing anyone with your place)
        - Busted (risky to fight in the place)
  5. First encounter (Basilisk Gate Market)
    - Open air market with stalls for cover
    - Stalls can be pushed over (Str 11) to block movement and create cover
    - Clothes, silk, food (rations, fruit, meats, candies), supplies, gold and gems, perfume, cultural books
    - 2 soldiers (veterans, mm351) + Captain Zodge (veteran, mm351, with rapier + main gauche +2AC)
      - Splint male gleaming with bronze Flaming Fist badges. Patch mustaches and guttural common, they are as diverse as the people they harry.
    - 12 rioters (commoners, mm345 - truncheons)
      - Desperate, scared, but with pained violence in their eyes
    - 4+4 Night Blades emerge from the shadows (avernus233)
      - Silent but subtle raspy breath, and a rythmic dribble
      - Enveloping black cloak, seemingly endless darkness gaze into it
      - Long kris daggers, issuing from flowing arms of robe
      - Wear pallid pig skull masks, dripping black ichor
      - Fanatical - will murder self and paint ley lines in own blood rather than reason
      - Bringing to civilization takes months of therapy, if not proof of mutual goals
    - 2-3 dozen of non-combatant merchants and civilians, fleeing
    - Turns:
      1. High tension between rioters and civilians, soldiers start to move to investigate
      2. 4 knives fly and hit rioters, who then start attacking civilians, soldiers start to brawl
      3. 4 nightblades emerge from shadows in each corner and silently start to murder
      4. ...
      5. 4 more nightblades jump down from second floor and engage soldiers
    2. Knives from the darkness injure commoners, and then they start attacking merchants and sacking the market
    3. Zodge and soldiers start trying to subdue, perhaps start pocketing money and merchandize
  6. Gratitude, walk them through the market explaining the situation. Press into service, debrief with his colleague Tarina at Elfsong Tavern, menace that he doesn't brook insubordination
  7. Flaming Fist deputization means ability to walk the street unharassed by gangs during the day. But you should be wary of the Cult of the Dead Three 
  8. Follow rest of text
