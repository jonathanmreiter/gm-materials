- Resting and Repairs
  - Rest -> Allows for quick repairs based on rolls and abilities that require rests
    - If no activity, heal half max HP, remove Down and Out
    - Full Rest is required to go back to max HP
  - Full repairs -> Must have 10 hours
    - Rebuild from scratch
    - Refresh all repair cap
    - Clear heat
    - Go back to full HP
    - Regain all charges
    - Can be obtained by power at cost roll
- Narrative Play
    - Consider to be the obstacles between sorties
    - Consider to be the prep between sorties
    - Defined as flowing skill checks
    - Skill check:
      - Goal -> Consequences
      - Triggers
      - 1d20 + triggers + accuracy + difficulty + teamwork (which can complicate failure)
      - 9- failure, 10+ success
        - Difficult = 10+ success, but with -1 modifier
        - Risky = 10+ success, but always brings consequences if under 20
        - Heroic = 20+ success
      - Non-risky skill checks can be pushed - re-roll which bumps up challenge (normal -> risky -> heroic)
    - Harm - normal (1-2), severe (3-4), deadly (6+)
      - Armor reduces harm
      - At 0, roll 1d6:
        - 6 returns to 1 HP
        - 2-5 down and out - 0 HP, pinned, stunned in mech (evasion -> 5), and dead from more damage
        - 1 is dead
- Sorties
  - Immediately establish goal + stakes
  - If it will change in situ, perhaps make it broader to keep from being unfair
  - Prep:
    - Choose mech
    - Choose outfit (player and mech)
  - Establish Reserves (pg 50-51):
    - Gotten from downtime
    - Can be gear, relations, information, any sort of useful assets
    - Reserves can have material affects on skill checks, or any other stat
    - They can be taken away or burned in the course of a mission
  - Boots on the Ground:
    - In media res
    - Could be narrative within mission
    - Not all missions imply combat, with mech or otherwise
    - However, throw the hex map up once mech aggression comes down
  - Debrief:
    - Level up (end of mission always increases License Level)
    - Talk about mission
- Downtime
  - Represents free time off mission, without immediately established obstacles
  - I think we will invoke it whenever players don't want to immediately address a threat, but instead need to play the waiting game
  - Thus trade off is:
    - Narrative can be used to focus on Sorties, and affect direct change faster
    - Downtime is more likely to bring in diverse reserves that are input intensive
  - Downtime Actions are a thing (pg 53-55)
    - Everyone makes one roll usually
    - See linked pages above
- Rolls
  - Skill checks
  - Attacks (Mech)
  - Saves (Mech)
  - Bonuses - accuracy (+1d6 to roll), difficulty (-1d6 to roll), triggers (+1d6 to roll), grit (+1)
  - Background can be invoked to add a accuracy or difficulty on skill checks
  - Triggers are always +2/+4/+6
- Combat Mechanics
  - Procedure
    - Start - declare combat, show the map (visible parts), explain the map, explain the situation
    - Turns -> Round
    - End of combat is judged when objective is carried out and characters disengage
  - Turns and Rounds
    - Players act first -> they can nominate someone, but the order doesn't have to be consistent between rounds
    - After one player acts, an NPC of GM choice acts
    - Continues until everyone has taken an action
  - Actions (pg 61)
    - Probably requires printing these out as cards
    - 1 standard move + (2 quick OR  full action)
      - Standard - speed based move -> maneuvering
        - Move
      - Quick - momentary actions -> pressing a button (pg 69-70)
        - Boost
        - Grapple
        - Hide
        - Quick Tech -> Bolster, Scan, Lock On, Invade (each count for duplication)
        - Ram
        - Search
        - Skirmish
        - Prepare
        - Self-Destruct
        - Shut Down
        - Eject
      - Full - directed choices -> unloading a barrage (pg 71)
        - Barrage
        - Disengage
        - Full Tech
        - Improv Attack
        - Stabilize
        - Boot Up
        - Skill Check
        - Mount/Dismount
        - Fight (on foot)
        - Jockey (on foot)
      - Reaction - special split second reactions that can be done out of turn
        - Brace
        - Overwatch
      - Free - special mech systems or talents -> boosting, even multiple times
        - Protocol
    - No duplication in moves EXCEPT for free actions and reactions
      - Overcharge - once per turn, take Heat to get an extra quick action
    - Movement (pg 62-63)
      - Standard
      - Move hexes equal to Speed
      - Can be split up between actions, allowing the actions to fully resolve (i.e. no move + full action + move)
      - Obstruction just like DnD
      - Hostile adjacency -> Engaged (+1 Difficulty) and immediately lose all movement
      - Move at half speed in difficult terrain
      - Engineering check if moving into dangerous terrain -> failure is 5 damage per round
    - Attacks (pg 64-)
      - Style of attack
        - Melee -> threatened -> 1d20 + grit + accuracy + difficulty vs. Evasion
        - Ranged -> range and LOS -> 1d20 + grit + accuracy + difficulty (-engagement -1|2 for cover) vs Evasion
        - Tech -> sensors and LOS -> 1d20 + tech attach + accuracy + difficulty vs E-Defense
      - Crits double damage dice
      - Attacks have patterns, just like DnD spells
      - Threat is basically maximum range (For both attacks and Overwatch)
      - Adjacency is needed for hard cover, as is lesser mech size
    - Damage
      - Burn ignores armor, is is cumulative (damage -> mark burn -> check at end of turn to see if additional damage)
      - Armor -> HP pool -> structure damage check -> structure hit -> HP reset -> destruction
      - Structure check:
        - 1d6 per structure damaged cumulatively, pick lowest result on table on page 80
      - Heat -> Heat cap -> stress + overheating check -> heat cap reset -> reactor meltdown
      - Overheating check:
        - 1d6 per stress damage marked, pick lowest result on table on page 8
      - Stabilize actions can reduce heat
      - At halfway of heat cap, Lancer in danger zone, is clearly red hot
      - Destroyed mechs can be repaired using 4 repairs.
    - Overcharge
      - Once per turn -> another quick action, even those already done
      - Take heat until full repair (1/1d3/1d6/1d6+4)

  - Conditions -> see reference on page 77-79
