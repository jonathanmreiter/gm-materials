On Exelion:
  Clear Out Medbay:
    - Filled with aliens
    - Can and should be scouted
    - Point of entry through a glass ceiling down into the atrium, or via the lobby
    - Scouting is thus possible through the top and bottom of the battlefield, and men can be dispatched on foot to quietly scout the rest
    - 3 floor fight up spiraling facility
    - Retreat is possible - everything heals, but only phagocytes get restocked
      Lobby: Open atrium with 10 phagocytes, some hidden in alcoves (demolished rooms)
      2nd floor: 6 needlers with 3 eyes, 4 natatrices
      3rd floor: An urchin core, 2 megastars, and 4 benthos
    - If seemingly beaten, Urchin Core will attempt to retreat - take refuge in Hab, escape to space and colonize parsec
  Investigate Archives:
    - Demons
    - Can be interfaced with via AI or comms
        - AI - can be corrupted
    - In there to learn the history of man
    - Don't want to be displaced, but willing to share the space
    - Stacks - rows of "bookshelves" that can be shoved
    - Damaging bookshelves is detrimental to their cause, and can lead to the Demons to negotiate
      Forces:
        - 4 Aims
        - 2 T1 Hornets + Umbral Interdiction (Ipos)
        - 2 T2 Priests + Fractal Assault (Byleth)
        - 1 Stolas
    - Unfettered access to the archives gives full access to ship manifests, knowledge of The Kingly Road, and mythos of factions (2 truths, 1 lie)

    Hab:
      - A cylinder of verdant mountains, streams
      - Bucolic
      - Colonial society tends to engineering, but right now everything is scarce, at whims of the stowaways
      - Culture tends to favor a yeomen's existence - after one's shift is done, retire to the countryside and sire generations, perhaps returning once more to cryo.
      - They also fear the Cossacks, who exact retribution for their noise
      - Quietly make sure they have sufficiency, and they will venerate you and treat you as governors for as long as the worldship exists
