Thosar I:
  - Welcome back Thosar. You've missed some serious hijinks! 
    - We learned of unnrest in Beanton, and of an impending troop of guards to quell the revolt
    - We delivered the Prince to the Archduke, in one piece, but with ample time for the Vizier to spill his beans
    - We returned to the dragon, Kolloth, and got our unicorn panacea from the dragon's trove.
  - Naturally, you got a little bit more from each of these encounters, as you were able to blend into the background. Feel free to use the moves below to fill in the gaps.
  - Hold 3:
    - A Warm, Messy Circle of Humanity: When you want to call in your favor with a hidden Beanton Revolutionary contact, roll Parley
      - Partial: They can do you a favor that is in their wheelhouse. Tell everyone how you did the same.
      - Full: They do your bidding, and you don't have to tell anyone how you got their devotion.
    - I Will Rain Chaos: When you recall something damning that the Vizier told you, roll Spout Lore.
      - Partial: The GM will tell you something relevant about the subject, and you have to tell everyone about this fact.
      - Full: It's your call. Make up something damning that makes sense, and it is reality. And now everyone knows.
    - If You Hack The Right Person... You Have A Piece Of Powerful Malware: When you produce a small object you stole from Kolloth's den, roll +Dex. 
      - On partial choose one, on full choose two:
        - Nobody saw you take the object
        - It does exactly what you expect
        - It's sought after by the right people
