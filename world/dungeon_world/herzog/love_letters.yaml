Thosar I:
  - Welcome back Thosar. You've missed some serious hijinks! 
    - We learned of unnrest in Beanton, and of an impending troop of guards to quell the revolt
    - We delivered the Prince to the Archduke, in one piece, but with ample time for the Vizier to spill his beans
    - We returned to the dragon, Kolloth, and got our unicorn panacea from the dragon's trove.
  - Naturally, you got a little bit more from each of these encounters, as you were able to blend into the background. Feel free to use the moves below to fill in the gaps.
  - Hold 3:
    - A Warm, Messy Circle of Humanity: When you want to call in your favor with a hidden Beanton Revolutionary contact, roll Parley
      - Partial: They can do you a favor that is in their wheelhouse. Tell everyone how you did the same.
      - Full: They do your bidding, and you don't have to tell anyone how you got their devotion.
    - I Will Rain Chaos: When you recall something damning that the Vizier told you, roll Spout Lore.
      - Partial: The GM will tell you something relevant about the subject, and you have to tell everyone about this fact.
      - Full: It's your call. Make up something damning that makes sense, and it is reality. And now everyone knows.
    - If You Hack The Right Person... You Have A Piece Of Powerful Malware: When you produce a small object you stole from Kolloth's den, roll +Dex. 
      - On partial choose one, on full choose two:
        - Nobody saw you take the object
        - It does exactly what you expect
        - It's sought after by the right people
Torlig I:
  - You somehow faded into the background while your comrades fought the untamed chaos inhabiting this land, and entering into the heart of corruption itself.
    - They saved the Unicorn from being overwhelmed by disturbing Myconid colonists
    - They found Gorin, and toured the bandit village that he lived in exile from the Duchy
    - They discovered the way to the Deep Under, taking the first steps through the trunk of the Matriarch tree
  - Unbeknownst to your friends, you were tying up some loose ends.
  - Hold 3:
    - Give Me Chastity, But Do Not Give It Yet: When you speak openly about your service to the Seraph, you may cast the following spells for the session per a level 1 Cleric,
      - Light, Sanctify, Guidance
      - Bless
      - Sanctuary
      - Cause Fear
    - And I Shall Count Thee Among My Favored Sheep: When you dispense with a sermon you learned from Bishop Morton, to fortify the spirits of all, roll Cha at +1
      - Partial: Full effect, but you open yourself up to attack
      - Full: All allies in earshot are at +1 forward
    - The Truth Will Set You Free: When you use your experiences fighting metaphysical lies to confront a corrupting figment, roll Wis at +1
      - Partial: Ask 3 questions from the Discern Realties list
      - Full: Ask the same list of questions, and the GM will also disclose how this relates to your faith
      - e.g. for Full, if a Fey lord is in control of illusory effects, you might also learn that the Fey's powers are descended from a holy grant from a rival Celestial to your Seraph.
In general:
  - What did you do with the Unicorn?
    - Accompany?
    - Set free, let it go deep into the Darkwood
    - Let Gorin accompany it?
