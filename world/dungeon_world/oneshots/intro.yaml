1. Intro: >-
"Dungeon World is a game of adventure fantasy. You'll play an adventurer in a dangerousworld. Maybe you fight for glory, or for profit, or for good or evil, or out of loyalty to your friends. You'll decide that here at the table, and the adventure will emerge around your decisions.""We're not going to play the origin story of this group. We're going to play through one of their adventures, so we start with everyone knowing each other and traveling together to the same destination. We'll figure out the dynamics of their relationship and the specific details of our journey after we create our characters."

2. Genre: >-
"Good games are often inspired by media. Let's figure out what material has inspired us within the broad genre of fantasy."
  - Everyone says one or more titles, any media
  - Write it down.

  - Wheel of Time
  - Magician
  - Blades in the Dark -> Steampunk with magic, no sun
  - Hope
  - Witcher -> Serious politics
  - Dark Sun Rising -> Vampires (way too grimdark),

5. Stuff to do:
  Cleric:
    - Cabals (Thieves Guild)
    - The sick, bloodied, diseased (Thieves Guild too!)
    - Divine signs if they cast a spell or do something miraculous. Is it alien?
    - Ask how it feels to be effected by spells - what about non-believers?
    - Give them zombies (out of control)
    - What does Communing look like?
    - Ask what specific acts fulfill precepts of religion
  Thief:
    - Spill traps all over the place, ask what they learned from the trap
    - Spill locked chests, mechanisms, hiding spots, dead drops, cant, etc. all over the place. Ask them what they know about the turf, tradecraft, etc.
    - Give them somebody unaware, can be backstabbed or disarmed
    - Ask them how much the treasure is worth, ask them how'd they fence it, and who wants it.
  Wizard:
    - What do they do when preparing spells. What does the book look like, how do they study it, how did they compile it.
    - What does casting a spell look like. Are they draining the world, or drawing from another? Are they channeling fromt he spirits of dead mages? Are they using their own body, and if so, what do they feel?
    - Do something to break the rules for spellcasting, and let them figure out how it works.
    - Ask what Places of Power look like. Stone circles that act as mana batteries? Unseen ley lines? Blood ssacrifices or weird ordained star formations? How do rituals interface with these Places?
    - Feed them a place to do a ritual, session 1. Make them feel clever for finding it. 
      - Make it something that has to be done in tandem with another spellcaster
      - Cleric: Something radiant that interfaces with Gorian?
      - Immolator: Something channeling (draining) the fires within?
      - Necromancer: Dead spirits or some sort of persistent blood loss?
      - Illusionist: Something drawing phantasms from internalized trauma, or something drawing Shadows from realms that should not be? Is it Gorian's realm?
  Immolator:
    - Give them lots of flammable things (corpses?) to burn, and let them use it as their canvas (until it goes out of control)
    - Toss them friends, rivals, lovers, enemies who are passionate and driven by conflicting opinions
    - Give them a burning wreckage or a battlefield ablaze, and let them try to puzzle at what happened.
    - Give them the bodies of people they know to burn and give eternal rest
    - Give them something cherished and foreshadow it burning to a crisp
