Passing Caravans:
  1. A train of 4 oxen, with lead bars, travelling at unsafe speeds, led by an Air Genasi with an exquisite scimitar, looking for a way to cheat The Guild, on the lookout for Wyverns.
  2. The famous Candlekeep Cognac train, cantering at a slow pace, with drivers yelling from one another. Mortlock is taking the reins, eying the road for bandits. He wants to know what has happened to his family.
  3. A loan wagon lead by mules. The scarred thug guiding it smiles at you with a teeth filled with gold. They carry the black scorpion venom.
  4. A few people on foot armed with heavy crossbows surround a single massive warhorse, and on it, a Goliath woman of impressive stature. She is Calypso, and is due for a prize fight in Baldur's Gate.
  5. A long wagon train pulled by giant monitor lizards, led by a mean looking man with barrel chest, repeater crossbow, and an eyepatch named Virgil. They carry wagons filled with water, and a carriage. In that carriage is the Lizardman champion, Dorian, who waves at you arrogantly.
  6. A pack of 6 ghostwise halfling bandits riding mastiffs led by a warrior riding a displacer beast. He's The Ghostface Killer, and he wants your valuables or your life. They are satisfied with 100GP worth of loot, and ride off 20 miles off the way, to their Spectre Fen camp. They live a hedonistic life. 
Endless Chants:
  1. "The man is not who he seems. He dies but lives below. He lives below but plots forever. When he is joined with the dragon, all will fall." (This is about Thavius, his plans with the vaultkeeper, his plans with Tiamat.)
  2. "A shield blocks all harm. A shield bears all marks. Beware the shield's memory." (The shield of the hidden lord is useful but has an agenda.)
  3. "Idol remembered in mithral, face mirrored on coins. Fractured metal slab, renunication clad. Nourishment extract from subjects. This god in an alcove." (Gargauth's likeness is on soul coins, is an exile from Avernus, and will use you for his own ends. He is bound to the shield, and he is livid about his lack of influence.)
  4. "Chivalry alive. Chivalry kills. Chivalry but dies a false death. We must keep chivalry alive." (Reya will be goaded into murdering Thavius, but this isn't her crime)
Staircases:
  Look:
    1. Opalescent rod, penetrating out into heaven. Titanium slab steps appear as you walk up, magnetized to the pole. The entire thing is exposed and there's no handrail
    2. Rickety wooden staircase, kept in place with lashed reeds. There's no exposed sides, but the whole thing creakys
    3. What looks like a loom extends upward, defying gravity. Yarn strands dangle in the stuff air, spliced into a loose braid. The shuttle appears, a block of ordinary elm wood flying down the yarn, the first step upward this slack line. As you gingerly take the first step onto the shuttle, you feel an intense pulling sensation and are immeditely on the porch to a spacious tower, hundreds of feet above the Library.
    4. A lazily winding spacious victorian wrought iron staircase, appearing to be more pergola than staircase with a colorful stained glass windows blocking out the wind and elements. The windows tell the story of a girl learning to read an ancient language, character by character, aided by a wizened old Elf. 
  Height:
    1. A tower remains within the roof of the Main Library, a shelter within the spacious dimensions of the building
    2. The staircase slants through a corner of the Main Library, and the tower awaits, peeking out obtusely
    3. The staircase meanders a full 100 feet above the Library, pirouetting together and then away from the reader complex
    4. The stiarcase loops up 50 feet above the Library, and then loops perilously down, ending with a tower propped up on the main library ceiling. The climb remains ever upward, however.
  Tower:
    1. Ordinary door leads to a comfortable cottage with a roaring fire.
    2. Adamantine door leads to a locked room, which when opened leads to the edifice of a labryinth
    3. Bricked off (illusory?) - leads to one of the others
    4. Industrious, work tables, a forge, bookshelfs with iron chains linking the books
