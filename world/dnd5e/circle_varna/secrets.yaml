Study of the Devil Contract:
  - Ilmater clause
    - Zamiza provides your new body, perfectly befit for your soul
    - On natural expiration of body in 7 years, your soul becomes property of Zamiza (retainer to Bel)
    - "These terms and conditions qualified by the Ilmater Clause"
  - Go to Illmater Tenement
  - Next door to Jopalin's, a cafe with sketchy and tired looking folk (opium den in basement)
  - Head cleric, Derek the Cleric, a jovial lightfoot halfling with rosy cheeks
    - "An Ilmater Clause? In devil writings? Only in youngling tales have I heard such thing"
    - Lent a book to Jopalin's
  - Door ring opens, dark and moody tea house with faded and peeling yellow flowered stucco walls
  - Ira Jopalin asks if he can help you, says that bookshelves are for paying customers only
  - Bookshelves don't have the book, only downstairs
  - Jopalin wonders if you are hip enough to go downstairs, and whether you are a cop
  - Look around den - everyone is minding their own business, doesn't want anyone's bother
  - It is being used to prop a hookah table up
  - "Ilmater, Man of Alms" tells the several stories of Ilmater, begging in the city of Calimport
    - Late in the day, a dessicated-dry piece of polish drift wood overturned his alms bowl
    - It is a Bleached Disciple, a spindly pale elf in a white caftan, grinning cruelly
    - She stole the coppers from the bowl and excoriated Ilmater with her rod
    - Ilmater stood firm, and looked at her eyes, "I see sadness in your cruelty"
    - Growling, she slit Ilamters wrists saying, "My life belongs to the lash and hook of the Prime Kyton of the Pain Maiden. If I cannot possess my life, not one beggar deserves their life."
    " To this Ilmater embraced the Bleached Disciple saying, "I shall take your pain".
    - She was absolved of her sins, her soul untethered from the Prime Kyton's chains, which have dug further into Ilmater's uncontainable soul
    - Ilamter smiled as his blood flowed from his wrists and along the Bleached Disciple's collarbones. "So long as Toril pitches me but one alm, I will take all their debts forevermore"
    - You may relieve yourself of this debt should you enter The Weeping Garden

1. 40x40 foot room. Cots, armory with glaives and half plate, crates and dog dishes, empty canoe racks, four sets of oars, ladder up (large)
2. Up a ladder, study. Ladder continues to roof, where spined devils still fight with the ominous birds. Arrow slits and a dozen pairs of chains. Gnome wizard (Alfonso) chained to chair in the middle, playing chess against a Chain Devil. North is an L shaped desk where a grusome squat fiend (Calder the Amnizu) in rich robes is barking moves to the Chain Devil (Berk). He wears a pickelhauber and is moving troops on a map, depicting the Styx and its shores. He has a boat on his desk.
  - Alfonso died and somehow came to be in Avernus with his chessboard, on the banks of the Styx. He just wants to live, and as a noble ponce, has no taste for combat. Aware of Avernus, wants to map it, but also terrified. (level 5 Graviturgy wizard)
  - Berk serves Calder, hates his ass, but fears his infernal powers
  - Calder wants military valor, is terrified of the repurcussion of the Sibriex becoming unchained, wants the battlefield to get on his turf (on the Styx), but ultimately believes in his win over his foes, the Hell Knights of many different orders and the other Amnizu, (Dalton, Elton)

Berk Kovik's brother is Princeps Kovik, leader of The Eighth Remnant
  - Lost intelligence because of Berk's death

  Sword of Zariel <- Bleeding Citadel (giant scab that Avernus is trying to destroy it via Yeenoghu + Crokek'toeck) <- Bel or Olanthius
    - Devil Path

    - Demon Path
      Olathnthius <- Crypt of Hellriders <- Pit of Shummrath <- Mephisto <- Obelisk <- Mordakainen <- Spawning Trees

  Path <- Haruman's Hill <- Lulu <- Mad Maggie

Calder:
  - The Sword of Zariel exists deep within Avernus, within a scab on the craggy surface. I do not know where this - you can verify this on this map - but some powerful creatures may now.
  - In fact, pointing to Lulu, I believe that creature knows exactly where the Sword of Zariel lies, and it is just a matter of Stygian forces that hold that information back
  - I am reluctant to share my confidants. It exposes both of us to risks that I cannot utter. I will give you a counter offer to avoid probing further. Take my arm, and call it even.
