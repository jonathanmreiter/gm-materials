Bookbag of Holding
  Cousin of the Bag of Holding. A worn leather and very wrinkled bag that appears at first to be something of a cubic sleeping bag. Can be extended up to 4 feet, at a time, with the rest of the bag wrinkling up. It cannot be physically extended more than 4 feet at a time, but if it were, it would be 500 feet long. Each face of the bag interior contains a small bookshelf, holding 500 books each. Thus, it can hold 2,000 books total, with at most 20 books accessible at a time. One can access and/or stretch the Bookbag with an action. The Bookbag cannot be turned inside out, and will never spill its contents when upended. In all other aspects, it is identical to the Bag of Holding.
