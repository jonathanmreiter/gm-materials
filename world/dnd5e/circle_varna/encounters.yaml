Living Axe:
  - Invitation with a rune for axe in blood, telling you to show at the High House of Wonders at midnight
  - Massive marbled temple complex with corinthian columns framing a vestibule nearly an entire city block
  - In front, on the steps, is a gaggle of squat figures in cloaks with hoods drawn talking amongst each other in hushed tones
  - They see you walk up and a ruddy dwarf in rich ermine trimmed robes unhoods himself. It is Flintblade, the man you argued with at the bathhouse.
    - Flintblade is a stubborn and greedy quarry options speculator, and a Warduke of the Lord's Alliance.
    - He believes gathering The Living could guarantee security for Sword's Coast, as well as give Baldur's Gate a supremacy over Waterdeep within the Alliance which could be profitable
    - He is merely using the cult as a tool, not a believer
    - It also guarantees his immortality within the Flint annals
  - He leans on a glaive with a fat blade that ends in a flourished nib. Enscribed on its width is a platinum-plated stylized eye. You rub your eyes, and you swear it is following you.
  - Flintblade waves for you to follow at his side. "I never would have thought it would have been a self-hating dwarf of your lowly stature..." He looks at the Bloodfury Axe with envy and awe.
  - The pack leads you winding through the wide plazas of the temple. At front is an uncloaked gnome with spiked assymetrical hair. "That's Jeribolt Voidwrench, our leader"
    - She is the Chief Architect of Baldur's Gate, and second hand to the High Artificer of Gond
  - Doubling back through the tinker hall and up a zig-zagging flight of stairs, you realize you are going deeper private Gondar laboratory space, and you start to feel like an intruder
  - Finally, Jeribolt opens a set of double doors leading to a broad room jam packed with workbenches. A massive forge is set up in one corner, and three tons of armor and weapon racks are littered in the other.
  - As people file in, a suit of armor with infernal eyes (Helm Horror) offers a demitasse of frothing liquid. They down it in one gulp, the infernal eyes watching intently all the time.
    - Wisdom saving throw, DC 23 Geas not to speak of this
  - Everyone takes seats on the work benches. Everyone seems to have beautifully strange weapons that they lay on the tables. They match the ornate instruments packed in the racks.
  - Jeribolt, still standing, addresses the crowd, maybe two dozen folks gossiping about, packed int he lab who all appear to be Dwarves and Gnomes of all classes and creeds, men and women
  - "You are here to witness and join the union of two aligned parties."
    - Left hand sweeps towards Flintblade "Of our lords"
    - Right hand sweeps towards a dwarf with a milky white eye, grinning and holding a massive double-bladed axe with a bronze edge that appears to be flowing and rippling "Of our masters"
      - This is Ragnar Olmheim, leader of the Living Axe
      - He is a zealot among and outcast from his Dwarven Hall
      - The Olmheims were known Orcslayers, and he turned his back on his family to possess the Living Axe
      - He believes that enthroning The Living will bring about immortality for himself and his clan
    - Hand goes inward "Of our faith"
  - "Among our ranks is an initate. Rise, Thorin."
    - Ragnar places the axe to your neck, and it laps at your jugular like waves crashing against a granite bluff. An ancient dwarven voice booms in your head, "Welcome, comrade!"
    - "Flintblade informed us that Bloodfury chose you." Flintblade grimaces, betraying pride and envy
    - "Our lord-marshall has returned."
    - "The ascendancy of the Living Axe has begun. Gond and Baldur's Gate will follow our lead."
    - "Flintblade, tell him what must be done. Axes, withdraw to Helm and Cloak." They leave
  - As the Axes file out, Flintblade puts a hand on your shoulder.
    - "I know we didn't get off on the best foot last time. I've forgiven your bill."
    - "But there's something that you must know, and will serve all of us well."
    - Handbill of Lyre of Apollo - it is a handsome lyre with golden mottled turtleshell and what looks like dazzling horsehair strings
    - "We believe we know where this is. Locked deep in Candlekeep. Yearning to be free and join the Living."
    - "If you can sketch its coordinates, determine how it is secured, and make sure that the Lyre is healthy, we can plan our next moves."
    - "If you can do that, without alerting the authorities of our plans, we can make it worth your while."
  - Go to Helm and Cloak for drinks among the Gondmen

High Hall Conspiracy:
  - Francis, the Black Books store manager, mentions off hand that he's attending People's Union Hall meeting at the High Hall at 8.
  - The People's Union Hall is a group of likeminded citizens of Baldurs Gate trying to obtain a seat on the Council of Four
    - The people are represented in the Parliament of Peers, but this is merely a rubber stamp approval body
    - The city is just a corrupt plutocracy without representation at the highest echelon
  - Whistlestop the Kenku is the leader of the Union Hall. He is a singer and hurdy-gurdy singer, and he works as a topman for the Birds of a Feather
    - He doesn't seek power, doesn't want the seat. But he's a magnetic speaker and affable 
    - He's a genuine patriot. He loves Baldur's Gate and fears for its decadent fall
    - He's also a Harper, wears their pin, and is on the ropes with the organization for his conflict of interest with the Union Hall
  - Francis introduces any characters to the meeting as guests, and Whistlestop hopes they will become full members, asking for a 1 GP fee to cover work stoppages and other organizing expenses
  Business points:
    1. A cannery in Rivington is on strike. It is being menaced by thugs (Rivington Rats). I want you to make sure the thugs don't come around, and that the workers can choose not to work as they please.
      - There's also scabs, who are kept out from working by a human chain. It is on the player to figure to get involved
    2. Rubo the Cobbler has had an emergency and needs a caretaker for his household in Little Kalimshan for one day only. We need a volunteer.
      - He's a Kobold, not at the meeting.
      - Sasa is a trap maker, who tries his best to avoid being caught in the house, and waits for the players with small traps everywhere
    3. It's time to raise more money for organizing, as the cannery strike has taken a toll. We need a volunteer to petition the Illibor trust for funds
      - Right next to the Wide is a small house used as the Lon Trust. It has a small lockbox with deposit certificates and 150 GP in petty cash, and a small vault with 1,150 GP in old Baldur's Gate stamped pressed bars in reserves (600 lbs), 150 GP in petty cash, and an accountant and 2 clerks.
      - A member of the family (Matthew says who) is around on weekdays, 10AM-2PM.
      - Grant making will require filling out a legalistic application and an in-person interview with a member of the family
      - All applications will be denied for insulting technicalities
  - Retire to the Helm and Cloak for trivia night
  - After the meeting, Whislestop asks for a favor - to pass a package to the Captain of the Low Lantern. Nobody can see this, and the Captain cannot know it is from Whistlestop.
    - The package is butcher paper holds a hewn off hand. It is multihued and has draconic scales. It has a ring of many gems (Tiamat's ring)
    - The Captain takes the package and demands to know who gave you this.
    - She also asks if you've ever seen an ivory dagger of similar build
    - She accepts the dagger, and notes that you're being watched and to be careful. She hands you a ring of protection.
  - Tiamat Brood are now stalking you. They attack when you sleep in the open, or the team is split 
    - 4 Dragonwings (white black red blue)
  - Returning to Whistlestop he reveals your ring to double as a Harper Pin. "Welcome to the Harpers, he whistles. The Captain will be your mentor."
