Candlekeep:
  Way of the Lion:
    - On the 4th day, Weather goes from humid to an heat storm. Rain pours down in a squall until the roads are thick with mud
    - On the 5th day, the rain subsides. Dark clouds gather threatening more rain ahead. The way branches into a wider road headed to the sea, punctuated by a signpost
    - A solemn raven perches on the signpost. "Way of the Lion, Candlekeep"
  Gatehouse:
    - Narrow, no more than 8 feet across with an closed portcullis.
    - Three people stand atop the gatehouse. A human, a shield dwarf, and a sun elf in purple robes. They wear brass talismans with a candle and an eye (symbol of Deneir, god of writing)
    - They are sitting around eating eels and porridge when you arrive. The sun elf stands with an abrupt, formal start.
    - "Welcome to candlekeep. Do you have your book return ready?"
    - They lower a bucket from a pulley system, dipping it up and down expectantly
    - Amulets glow as they page through the book
    Defenses: archmage + 1d4 archmages, 1d4 archmages reinforcements
  Court of Air:
    - As you enter through the gatehouse you are greeted by a spacious courtyard. It is well appointed with cypress treas, a small terraced sand rock garden encoded with runes (The contents of whatever is being chanted, in Hamarfae)
    - In long trailing purple robes you see a wisened woman chant in Common, see table.
    - Whenever Reya has a moment, she will try to murder Thavius at night. The Hidden Lord has no use for him or Elturel now. It is a seemingly irrational compulsion. She feels awful for the murder, and will turn herself in.
    - Whenever Thavius has a moment, he will run for it. He will try to convince people he is doing an errand for the team. 
    House of Rest:
      - (Garden of Learning, take a few leave a few bookcase with 1d6 random scrolls and 1d4 random potions)
      - A squat 3 story tudor style house. Workmanship style - bunks with lumpy down mattresses, a long boisterous cafeteria, and a swarm of severe looking docents in purple robes overseeing
      - Your bunk room is shared with a band of Halfings (from Beluir). They talk in their local tongue, and discuss where they want to go first (The special collection of satire by Sheela Peryroyl). They offer you a pot of freshly brewed chrystamum tea and a plate filled with orange and coriander flavored biscuits. "Care to accompany us to the special collections?" They bring you around and give you very artful descriptions of the structures and people.
      - Your stuff is stowed in a locker. (Reya tries to put away the shield, waits a beat as though unsure, and then straps it on her back with a vacant look in her eyes)
    The Hearth:
      - A lodge made with huge logs from petrified elder trees, and looking like a longhouse. Sandwiched between the public bathhouse and the House of Rest
      - The pub has a low ceiling supported by massive wooden crossbeams and narrow, shuttered windows. A large fire pit in the middle of the room is surrounded by a half dozen tables and matching benches.
      - (They serve mostly wheat beer and brandy. The wheat beer comes from Elturgard, and is expensive with the shortages with the fall of Elturel. The brandy comes from the south, from Amn, whose product is starting to sell favorably as Elturel's beer supply ran dry)
      - Maybe two dozen people mill about in parties of 2 or 3. There's a party of a dozen monks in the very middle of the room, raucously discussing a controversial book (Principia Discordia by F, an Aarakocra devotee of Aerdrie and powerful alchemist) with snifters of maroon drink.
      - In the NW corner, a massive humanoid teeters (Ogre, Little One) on a too-small chair reading a huge book (The Sum of Theology, St Vetheera of Oghma) that looks right sized for his mits.
      - His headband shines in the candle light. The barkeep comes by and they talk jovially and he refills his drink, a massive tankard bubbling with blonde foamy wheat beer.
      - There's beer and insights (in parens) about other locations
      - (The cellar leads to the catacombs. There's voices in your head that guide to Miirym, the Sentinel Wyrm, who will guide anyone interesting from the hearth to a sublair, to gossip. When bored, she teleports them back to the tavern, alongside a new flagon of her latest brew, a very strong gose made with the brine of the Sea of Swords and Elturelean wheat)
    House of the Binder:
      - On the west side of the Court, there's an austere stone building. Brutalist, slate grey and studded with fieldstone boulders, it is boxy and nothing much to look out. It has a sign of elm that is a blank scroll, and it creaks as it articulates against the stone bolt within the building with the wind.
      - Inside the great iron double doors is a forecourt, three smaller oak doors that lead to an interior hall. Echoing flagstone hallways, illuminated wallpapers, tesellating pair of spreadpalm human hands, bathing everything in an eerie golden light.
      - Benches in the hallway, filled with men of cloth talking quietly. Stone circle in austere courtyard, surrounding a simple shrine with an ancient carving on the spread hands. Overhead it is bathed with the solar illumination of a gigantic unfurreled papyrus, that is rapidly committing all contents of conversations to the log, faster than one can follow.
      - Avowed Immanuel Hewn is here during daytime hours, soliciting people to kiss the stone and tell Oghma their deepest secret, and occasionally seeing to the Seekers who encamp here, delivering food and directing them around the campus
      - He's sworn off fighting for all time, claiming that Candlekeep at peace is sufficient to guarantee his personal safety (and believing none can help him cease the infernal nightmares wracking his nights).
      - (He dreams of being trapped in a battle with devils and demons devouring each other eternally. Solace is coming to a tower filled with paupers, but right before salvation he awakens with a sweaty start)
      - (He can be convinced to make a trip to Baldur's Gate to see Derek the Cleric at the Ilmater Church.)
      - (He will also follow up on any leads anyone has about restoring his diabolical wounds or creating a prosthetic, which is the main body of his research)
  Main Keep:
    - Towering edifice, dozens of story high, much taller than any building you've seen in Baldur's Gate. Tiny spires split off of the main edifice, each with jaunty pointed roofs,
    - Odd monks will offer directions to the Great Library and through the directory
    Great Library:
      Trapdoors:
        - For each stairway examined, roll 1d12. On 11-12, there's a lip on the rug/first stair/handrail that exposes a trapdoor down (DC 17)
      - The base of the spire, and the biggest room any of you have seen, nearly the size of the entire House of High Wonders. Books are everywhere in shelves that flank many precarious spiral staircases. These form a forest that weaves around, creating a canopy against the walls that are completely stuffed with shelves.
      - (Aleister, you've been here. You don't know when. Your cannot access that memory. It feels like a long, long time ago when this forest of stairs were a mere orchard)
      - Scholars are scrambling for books everywhere. They whisk books off shelves with tall polls and ethereal hands. They levitate up to shelves to browse. One enterpising gnome has several disks weighted down by books and is struggling to weave through the stacks without razing them to the ground.
      - You notice a thin cast iron spiral staircase at the far wall. The shelves around it form an oaken knee-length helix, neatly appointed with scrolls, and forming a slender "S" with an latticework of platinum. It jutts up and out the north wall of the great keep. 
      - (It would take all day to map out every single staircase. It would take a lifetime to track down every book. But the Ordo Occultatum Catalogo (OOC), who have the grandest staircase right at the enterance, have charms and divinations that have helped them document an outstanding 10% of texts within Candlekeep. The staircase doesn't spiral, but instead inclines near vertically, and makes up a spire that parallels the main edifice of the building, a series of offices and secretive Special Collections dedicated for the Great Readers)
    Reader Complex:
      - (Along the cardinal directions of the walls are stairway-lobbies. They go to specialized wings of the library, known as Special Collections. They are thematically organized, and have strict visiting hours and 3 access levels - Seekers, Avowed, Readers. They are each tended to by Avowed docents, who are managed by a Reader specializing in the theme).
      - The staircases continue for 15 floors on each cardinal direction, leading to a locked door (DC 18, keys carried by Avowed).
      - (Floors 16-20 constitute services levels, with mechanical lifts and boilers run by Gondians, custodial offices, security posts for the Keeper Order elves, kitchens, etc. These are built into the roof of the grand library, and creates the last part of the foundational volcanic edifice of the keep. The wings carry the most controversial Special Collections, and are only accessible by Great Readers and their staff.
      - (Floors 21-50 are considerably more locked down, with magical vaults for entry above. It is the offices and dormitories for the Great Readers. Few see them regularly, beyond the Chanter, and nobody goes here. Some say that the Great Readers purposefully sequester themselves for decades. We do know mechanical lifts through the central spine of the building go to these floors, but it is charmed to say the least.)
    Sylvira's Necessarium:
      - 150 feet up and out of the library's roof and the oak book case stops, and in its place a patchwork of adamintine plates sealing out the stormy dark clouds and cool cool air.
      - (It looks like chunks of the wall have been eroded out. As you spiral west, You snatch a view of the roiling Sea of Swords and catch a freezing briny gust - perhaps it has been eroded by the salty sea air or the frost of the winter)
      - 300 feet up and you find a door that is well sealed and perfectly circular. There's a knocker that looks like a spyglass, cylindrical with many rotating layers (it is a cosmological model of the Nine Hells). When your fingers wrap along the top of the spyglass the layers seperately, a red light glows, and a hollow echoing knock rattles the door and down the stairs. It is silent for a deadly second. And then a cheerful "Come in! I've been expecting you!" Calls out gingerly
      - The walls of this circular tower chamber are punctuated by arched windows that are currently shuttered. Bookcases filled with eldritch volumes stand between the windows, while tables are crowded with specimen jars, alchemical equipment, and other clutter. Engraved into the floor of the chamber is a large, nine-pointed star.
      - A middle-aged tiefling dressed in wizardly robes stands by one of the windows, caught in a fugue of intense contemplation. Perched on the corner of a table nearby is a spindly little demon with warty green skin (Jezebel the Quasit Familiar), buggy eyes, thin black horns, and a whip-like tail.
      - "Ahh, Falaster! You've returned with friends. I smell the kindling of devilfire among you, most intriguing. It's always a treat to smell the familiar stench of home."
      - (If Thavius accompanies, he rebukes Sylvira as an archdevil and implores the party to destroy her. Sylvira yells at them to leave her tower at once, and to bring him to the authorities. He runs for it.)
      What brings you by?:
        Puzzle box or Thavius:
          - "Thavius? That perfidious cretin? Nobody believes that blackguard betrayed us but me. What say you, adventurers?"
          - Reya disputes this, he's the hero of Elturel, saving it from wave after wave of ghastly foes from the grave
          - "Tsk. You Elturelians are the true hero. You swore an oath, the Creed Resolute, to keep your nation alive. But this oath is not what you think, and I believe this puzzle box will tell all."
          - She runs to a walk in closet next to her cot, and starts flinging out puzzle boxes in every dimension. She finds one that looks like a burnished metal rubicks cube, and brings it near the Puzzle Box. She studies it carefully, and then asks the Imp to get her the Puzzle Grease. She pours the flask with a bright blue and yellow label into the mazelike troughs carved into the box’s surface. She then tips the box so that the liquid flows in certain directions through the mazelike patterns—until the box’s horn inlays pop loose and it breaks apart.
          - Inside the box is a stack of 9 chain linked plates, looking eeriely like the door's knocker. 3' to side, and skillet-like cast iron. On it are infernal runes:
            > Be it known to all that I, Thavius Kreeg, High Overseer of Elturel, have sworn to my master, Zariel, lord of Avernus, to keep the agreements contained in this oath. I hereby submit to Zariel in all matters and for all time. I will place Her above all creatures, living and dead. I will obey Her all my days and beyond with fear and servility. I recognize the dispensation of the device called the Solar Insidiator, hereafter called the Companion. In my capacity as High Overseer of Elturel and its vassal territories, I acknowledge that all lands falling under the light of the Companion are forfeit to Zariel. All persons bound by oath to defend Elturel are also considered forfeit. I further recognize that this dispensation will last fifty years, after which the Companion will return whence it came, taking Elturel and its oath-bound defenders with it, if that is Zariel’s wish. All this is my everlasting pledge.
          - "Why, Overseer?" Reya faints, bloody tears of wretched grief in her eyes.
          - When she awakens, "If Zariel wants my soul, she's welcome to take it."
        Shield of the Hidden Lord:
          - "Ah yes, I read about this in the Dead Gods collection. This shield celebrates good over evil, but there's a terrible force inside. Gargauth is the Hidden Lord, a pit fiend sent by Asmodeus to corrupt, only to be sundered into this very shield. It radiates dark energy, and yet the Hhune patriars of Baldur's Gate held onto it. Toril is a worse place with this in its existence. It should be locked away extradimensionally."
          - (A vacant gaze on Reya's face once more.) "That can't be true. Its egress from Elturel is what doomed it in the first place. Bringing it back to where it once was is the only way to make my home whole."
          - (Doubt clouds Sylvira's face) "Who told you this? (Is your mind clouded by Gargauth?) I wouldn't suggest you take your chances, but perhaps you need to accompany it to learn right from wrong (she clucks her forked tongue in disapassionate judgement)"
            Nobody believes Gargauth, or they want to leave it with Sylvira:
              - A booming (rich, decadent, beautiful) voice fills the room, "Excellent! Most excellent! You fellows have solved two diabolical puzzles today. What a grand achievement" (it aches with sarcasm)
              - "As a reward, I have a mere request for you: please bring me to the nine hells and I will serve you faithfully. I shall act as your closest consigliere. I promise you will be far safer in my company than without it. After all, There's no better bulwark in hell than the devil himself!"
              - (If they want to draw up a contract, Gargauthe begrudingly allows it. He produces a massive contract that spills out through the room, but it retracts into a single cover page. He may even assent to a simpler contract tailored to mortals. It is to be signed with the blood that oozes from the emblem's eyes, and one accepting principal. Reya will never accept this deal.)
              - After concluding the deal, Sylvira looks relieved. "Thank god I don't need to need to hang on to this. I don't need to file for another insurance policy."
        Save Elturel:
          - "Right, this seems like our best option, and I can only hope you're the best people to do this heroic deed. Please take this, it'll be your best bet."
          - Show map
          - "Now this might not be entirely reliable. Our finest cartographer transcribed many humanhind journals to make this. They retired to a shack deep in The Cloakwood and we haven't seen them since. Maybe they are alright?"
          - She waits a beat, and then hangs her head. "No. Definitely not alright. Definitely disturbed."
          - "As to getting to Avernus, we'll have to take a field trip to meet a trip sitter. High Wizard Traxigor lives in a tower purpose built for these sort of jaunts into Avernus, and can help further provision you for your journey. When you're ready to go, I want you to find Ataxia at the Gatehouse, and tell them Sylvira sent you."
          - They can study or do other stuff. Falaster leaves for BG at this point.
          - Ataxia is the elf who greeted you at the gate earlier. Says, "Ah, the heroes of Baldur's Gate. Exciting stuff"
          - You climb several narrow stairs widing 50 or more feet up the gatehouse. Near the very top, Ataxia ushers you to a crescent-shaped landing platform with a stunning view of the sea. Waiting for you atop this platform are several griffons with saddles, their handlers standing nearby to help you. “The griffons only go to Traxigor. They have a soft spot for that... old... so and so.” (Ataxia truly looks lost at how to describe Traxigor)
          - Perched on the backs of the griffons, they scree and take flight with flaps so hard they squeeze the air out of your lugs and pop your ribs. Just below the squalling clouds and high above the foaming tide of the dawning sea, you pass wordlessly over rocky reefs and islands ushering forth into the open sea, westward bound. 
          - An hour passes, and the squall clouds have parted. The sun is setting, but the seas are tranquil, but the horizon is dotted with trade ships headed to Baldur's Gate and its Chidnthar River.
          - Two more hours pass and it is dark. Velvet skies are painted with motes of light from the cosmos, and a moon veiled by patchy clouds. The dark waters below are dotted with luminescent shapes your eyes have never seen before (A colony of Tritons, deep in the clear dark waters. Their parapets sparkle with bioluminescent features. No doubt they watch you with the same interested gaze). The griffons stay in a delta formation, their wings gliding with slight humming noises.
          - Another hour passes, and then as the moon is high in the air and moon beams light up a wine dark ocean, animated, showing hints of chop under the surface. You trace the horizon and notice the rays illuminating an obelisk of a tower, rising out of the ocean. It is stone and windowless, and sleek, and its levitating motion promotes a foam below its absent foundation. The griffons pass through jagged holes riddling the tower’s conical peak to land on the top floor below, which has a spiral staircase leading down. 
          - Down the stairs leads to a cluttered chamber illuminated by various objects upon which continual flame spells have been cast. Scurrying around the room is an otter dressed in a tiny red cassock. The otter mumbles to itself in Common, mentioning something about a tuning fork. Suddenly, it takes notice of you and stands upright. “Lulu! Wake up! Our guests have arrived!”
          - At the sound of her name, a small elephant with golden fur appears from under a pile of blankets near a table strewn with alchemical equipment. The elephant takes to the air on feathery wings and lets out a pleasing trumpet sound. 
          - Traxigor roots around the blankets cursing at Lulu. "Have you been using my tuning fork to scratch your back again?"
          - Roll for trinkets.
          - Introduce to Lulu, "Now that we've found my fork, we can go to Elturel. I won't be staying long, but this fellow right over here has been aching to go back to Elturel."
          - You see happiness and rainbows and puffy clouds the spell out Lulu in your head. "This here's Lulu and she's the sweetest little muffin you'll ever find. Course, she never got along with Sylvie, and that's too bad. Pawned her off to me and my otter ass, assuming that we fluffy things get together. Of course, she was right, I love my little Lulu!" They embrace like old friends. "But times come for her to embrace her destiny with you"
          - She doesn't verbalize anything unless spoken to in Celestial. She telecommunicates images of the Hellriders led by an Angel wielding a massive greatsword tearing through a rift. But also there's outrides, who spring upon the flanks and close the rift up fast as if by a zipper.
          - Next there's an image of the leader angel. She's bloodied and looks hopeless. She is handing her massive sword to Lulu. She's pointing to the shadows cast by a mountain so big, it projects outward into the heavens and then wraps back under itself. She points deep into the shadows. There's a flicker of herself tromping off with the pommel in her mouth, and the blade in the hands of a blank faced grey humanoid. Who knows who that is. They are in the darkness. There's static. They are on the balcony with all of the nine hells laid out before them, the skies aflame. There's static. Then she's alone in vast marketplace filled with horned and lion-faced beings wearing colorful garbs and outlandish suits. There's static. Then finally there's an image of Lulu alone, weeping at the scar in the ground where the portal to Avernus once was. And then there's nothing.
          Lulu:
            - Hollyphant, will regain Light at will once at Elturel (Formerly Zariel's war mount, centuries old)
            - Friendship and love allows her to regain memories
            - She is ultimately good.
    Catacombs:
      Dragon:
        - Entering this domain fills your head with thoughts that are not yours that switch between intriguing and intrusive.
        - Following them puts you through the first, unoccupied chamber of 1d4 dungeons, and then to Miirym's den.
        - Wants to know stories. Can be convinced to trade one secret in exchange for a lift to the Doors of Apollo
        - If bored, asks, "Shall I take you home or away?"
          - Home brings you to the Hearth
          - Away takes you one floor down.
      - Accessible via the lifts (Avowed), and in some false floors in random parts of the main library.
      - Lifts also go to the Vault, but have key to open
      - https://watabou.itch.io/one-page-dungeon
      - Lots of sepulcures, 10 dungeons to the dragon lair
        - For each room, roll 1d4. On a 2, there's an common wondrous item or 100gp. On a 1, an uncommon wondrous item or a potion or 250gp
    Vaults:
      - A nest of forking branches of obsidian chambers carved into the old volcano that Candlekeep sits upon. But from one of them, light issues out. DC 10 to follow successfully. 
      There's 12 chambers to check:
        - Big locked door made of obsidian (DC 23)
        - 1d4 Avowed acting as security
        And choose 2:
          - Sight (You can see into the vault through beautiful lenses making up the door, but the Readers can see you too)
          - Charms (If you're not escorted by the Avowed, you are affected by the spell Sleep)
          - Bulwark (The door is actually a curled up Obsidian Golem, who in addition to having authorization, will only let those who interface with it telepathically to pass)
        - Apollo's Lyre is behind a Sight door. There's actually a crowd of Avowed there taking it in. There's music coming out as the Lyre appears to play itself in a chamber bathed in light, outfitted with marble arm chairs, cedar saplings, and a tranquil reflecting pool.
        - Voice will enter only Torin's head?

Protect while in the Nine Hells
