Pazari the Nazargon of Tiamat:
- A gold dragonborn who turned his back on Bahamut
- Melted his platinum sword down to pay for the murder of Patrin of the Platinum Cadre
- Claimed by Tiamat for his craven behavior, his only friend remains Lepodotus the Nightmare, a stillborn black drake
- He fights for naught but glory, hoping that his enemies' terror fills his craven void
- Tiamat dispatches him to make her rivals look pitiful and worthless, as Pazari fills them with fear and indecision
