    Exelion:
      - "Last thing you remember was going to sleep, shipping off on a millenial trip to found the great colony of New Volga. But now, you have awoken, in some piece of shit loaders, in the middle of space. The combat stims wane, and you look into the cylindrical glass of the Exelion worldship habitation zone as it soundlessly hulks forward and see the rest of the fleet in splinters. What do you do?"
      - Battlefield: Very recent. Gory. Potential survivors.
      - Exelion: Completely sterile, with skeleton crew. Operable. Potential stow-aways
      - Previous port: Have a grudge or bought into the kingdom
      - Next port: Won't allow ingress, or have useful resources
      - New Volga: An ancient perfect world bestowed by the Demiurge to the Don Ataman and his mighty Cossacks
      - Kingly Road: The universal horocycle, where when space-time is folded, travel is expedited massively, and all points of the universe may be observed
      - Demiurge: The omnipotent gods who created the Cossacks and all they cherish.
      - Why settle New Volga?
      - What is culture like among crew?
    Battlefield:
      - Survivors: *none, changed, only enemies
      - Scrap to pick: none, *dangerous ordinance, already claimed
      - Vultures: none, alien, *aggressors
      - Aggressors: port defense, empire, *alien, self
      - Cause: mass delusion, in-fighting, *ambush
    Exelion:
      - Massive worldship
        - 500c warp drive on an unalterable course on the Kingly Road
        - 100km long O'Neill Cylinder
        - 10 billion sleeping colonists
        - Paracausal Fusion (PCF) reactor core, dual used as the sone
        - Exterior Pylon with skeleton crew (10,000 strong)
        - Gimbaled railguns; damascene exoplating; 7 wings superiority fighters, long range bombers, and black ice ships; 70 wings drone interceptors. 
        - Repair and mech printing facilities
        - Dozens of GMS mechs for ground support and some zero g support (EVA module is free on GMS license mechs)
        - 7 Dropships with Cat Engines capable of instantaneous jumps
          - Room for 20 GMS mechs and gear
          - Neutrino point target + tachyon projection allows for hops of unlimited distance within the hyperbolic shape of space, bounded only by navigation direction
          - No weapons
          - Straying from initial tachyon projection, including subsequent hops, subjects those to time dialation effects.
            - i.e. the further you get travel from mission origin, the more time passes on the Exelion
