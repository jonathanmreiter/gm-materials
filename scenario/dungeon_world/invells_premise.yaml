    Pirate Ship:
      - "You're the crew of a pirate airship. The captain has just been killed. A call from the crow's nest comes down that the flagship pirate hunter of the local authorities has crested a fogbank and is ten minutes from engagement. What do you do?"
      - Crew: fearful, chaotic, selfish
      - Pirate Hunters: boastful, state of the art, legalistic (roll to see their allegiance, or default to Hegemony)
      - Local Pier: Roll or choose from locales below 
      - Remote Pier: Roll or choose from locales below
    Ship:
      - If there is a Captain, or any other playbook with a ship, it is their ship, it's just on them to marshall their crew.
      - Otherwise:
        - The ship isn't yours, but it might serve your whims.
        - It's a Large Flying Ship with a crew of 3-4 dozen.
        - Everyone wears many hats to get things going, but there are still cliques by station
        - Pick a name: Sajal, Hava, Topi, Saila Bana
        - Pick two upsides:
          - It's comfortable and can support much more crew
          - It is well stocked for trade and for self-sustenance
          - It can prove its mettle in combat and it looks that way
          - The captain's quarters are stocked with ages of gazetters and astrolabes and other useful navigation equipment
          - The ship and its crew is famous and well liked - everyone will come to the harbor when it is moored
          - It is supernaturally expedient in voyage and in navigating hazardous winds
        - And secretly roll the crew's morale:
          - Mutiny and broken into factions
          - Shattered, depressed, and looking to disband
          - Unphased, but likely only due to the shit they've seen
      Factions:
          - First Mate: Aligned with first mate, cruel and power hungry
          - Salty Dogs: Professional, cynical, driven by reason
          - Fresh Meat: Unprofessional, driven by ambitions and their sins
    Outpost of Paripurna:
      - A massive stalactite with spiraling roads, outpost bored into it and into the whole of the crust
      - Smells musty, feels dangerous - hair stands at end even in the mundanity
      - Tourism starved
      - Inaccessible, and hosting an even more inaccessible Walker mission
      - Launching a ship is a dangerous task, which requires help from crust based assets
      Stats:

        - Arcane items, research equipment, spiders

        - Quantitative measures of piety are collated, traded, and resold by scribes at Etemenaki
        - Rumored to be hard to travel to because the Priests of Etemenanki can dictate the winds from Sola

    Great Nation of Hegemony:

      - On actual land mass are Executive Offices
      - Capital run mostly by automata
      - Satellite nations are individual powers who joined to gain knowledge of automata themselves (Companies)
      - Nobody knows of the race that acts as the Executive
      Stats:
        - All manual labor is carried out by constructs, specialized per Company
        - Bound together by existential fear of World Eater has awoken, rain of debris from the constructs
        - Automata are scarce, so more work as multiplexed machines
        - Automata scarce due to lack of steam - need more facilities to create steam, need more fuel (conventional, arcane)
